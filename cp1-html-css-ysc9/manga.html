        are equivalent terms for graphic novels orginated from Japan, Korea, and America.
        Graphic novels most likely originated from Japan, but are first popularized in
        the US and the UK. Currently, the largest graphic novel market is in Japan.

      <h2>Why I Started Reading Manga/Manhwa?</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I was little, I hated reading because I was bad at english,
        but I loved to read graphic novels since its easy to understand. However,
        it was only until 8th grade when I started reading a lot of manga and manhwa.
        In middle school, my brother introduced me to anime and I loved it. However,
        I hated that I would have to wait months or maybe even years for the sequel
        to come out. Thus, instead of waiting, I started to read manga. Ever since then,
        I just read the manga instead of watching the anime. There are also many
        manga/manhwa that are very interesting to read but do not have an anime.
        Manga and manhwa updates weekly or monthly depending on the author and
        there are translators which translate them regularly so you don't have
        to worry about the language barrier. However, if can't stand the cliffhangers
        and waiting for the updates, you can also read the light novel version of the story.
        Overall,I find reading manga/manhwa a great way to spend my free time, and I hope
        you'll like it too!
